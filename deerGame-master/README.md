# deerGame

This game was made to understand the basics of Unity. In the game, it is essential to process keyboard inputs, move the player and produce moving random objects in random locations. In this game, the user throws food with the space key by moving only to the left and right in a fixed plane. The aim is to deliver these foods to oncoming animals.
